    "For each column, you'll consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Type Conversion (CAST)**: Ensure the data is in the correct type (e.g., STRING, INT64, FLOAT64, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text: TRIM() whitespace, UPPER() or LOWER() for consistency, REPLACE() special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numeric: Handle NULLs (e.g., COALESCE(column, 0)), scale units (e.g., convert meters to kilometers if depth is in meters and you want depth_km).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dates/Timestamps: Convert to standard UTC timestamps, handle timezones if tz is consistently populated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Renaming**: Give columns clear, consistent names (e.g., mag to magnitude, time to event_timestamp_utc). We will do column renaming in gold layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Basic Filtering/Validation**: Simple WHERE clauses for very obvious invalid data (e.g., id IS NOT NULL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Approach for Testing (in your schema.yml files):\n",
    "For each column (or the model as a whole), you'll add tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generic Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **not_null**: Ensures a column never has NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **unique**: Ensures all values in a column are unique (great for IDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **accepted_values**: Ensures values are from a predefined list (e.g., status must be 'reviewed', 'automatic').\n",
    "\n",
    "- **range**: Checks if numeric values fall within an expected min/max.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **relationships**: Checks foreign key relationships between models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Singular Tests: Custom SQL queries to test specific business rules that generic tests can't cover."
